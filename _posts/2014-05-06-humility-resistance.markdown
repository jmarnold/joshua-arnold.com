God has woven this theme of humility into my life this month. Humility in my career, in my marriage, as a father, and as His servant. I blindly followed it. I blindly followed the voice of our creator because I know that He makes ALL things work together for our good. However, I began to find myself questioning where it was all going. “What would you have me do?” is the question I found myself begging (more like screaming).

A wall had begun to form. I could sense His presence but I felt that *I* was holding something back. This song has brought me to me knees in my battle against God. It was a battle that I didn’t even know that I was fighting. I’ve been holding back from surrendering EVERYTHING. In a moment of worshipping with all that I am, He gave me the wisdom to understand the purpose for this.

A season of humility isn’t necessarily a punishment. He has something inside of you that He isn’t ready to unleash. The power of His will for your life is not only beyond our comprehension, it’s beyond our ability to wield. We cannot contain the power of our God and when He begins to move, He moves mightily. He’s just waiting to be sure that you won’t get in the way.

When He calls you to humility, He’s calling you to himself. He’s drawing you closer. He’s saying: “I know you need me. I want to show you more of who I am”. Because it is ONLY through our humility that we are able to begin to comprehend the majesty and glory of our King. 

This morning I had James 4:8 on my heart. I decided to jump back a few verses and this entire thread of humility became much more clear to me.

> Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members? 2 You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet[a] you do not have because you do not ask. 3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures. 4 Adulterers and[b] adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 5 Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously”?

(_James 4:1-5_)

### 1. Pride creates a wall between us and God

We lust and do not have, we covet and cannot obtain, we fight and we war. If we ask for the desires of our prideful heart, God knows that he cannot trust us. He knows what we will ACTUALLY do with the things we ask for. Have you ever promised to give God 50% of the money you win in the lottery? Now, have you given him $5 out of the $10 that is in your pocket? How about 50% of the last bonus check from work? See how that works?

When you reach your goals, the success that you’re chasing, to whom will you give the glory? Will you continue to stay faithful to God or will you forget about him? The answer is simple. Do you give Him the glory today?

James goes on to say in verse six:

> 6 But He gives more grace. Therefore He says:
> 
> “God resists the proud,
> But gives grace to the humble.”[c]

When we harbor pride in our hearts, we create a wall. Most of the time we don't even know that it exists yet we scream at God: "Where are you?!?" Asking "where is God" is never the right question. Our God does not move. He does not leave our side. He waits patiently for us to humble ourselves before Him. It is then that we are able to fall under His grace and draw near to Him. For when we draw near to Him, he draws near to us (James 4:8).

### 2. Pride is the hidden source of war between us

We MUST identify this source of conflict.

> For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places

Pride does not separate us from God but it gives the enemy a foothold. And a foothold is ALL he needs to wage war within our friendships, our minds, our marriages, and our families. Pride forces a perspective that is centered around ourselves. *I* want this, *I* should've been asked to do that, *I* am qualified for this. 

> If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.

Ask Him for humility today. In a NEW way. Pursue him with a new fervor and take back the ground which the enemy has stolen.
