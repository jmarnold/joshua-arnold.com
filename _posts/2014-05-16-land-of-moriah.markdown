Tension forms when our faith is tested. The fleeting thoughts of doubt begin to linger, we become frustrated, and we lash out out of desperation. It's ironic that during these tests we run from the things that we need the most: prayer, worship, and reading His word.

Too many times we become angry or frustrated with God because we don't hear Him at the exact moment we want to. We want an audible demonstration from our creator and become agitated when He doesn't meet our demands. Let's just think about that one for a moment.

We're saying that because the maker and creator of the universe doesn't bow to your need in a moment's notice, you think you have the right to be upset? How about we show God that we love Him enough to spend time in His word? When you're in a true relationship, you spend time learning more about them (whether you like it or not). When we seek Him and pursue His heart by reading His word, we draw nearer to Him. His word tells us in James 4:8 that He will draw nearer to us as we draw nearer to Him. So MAYBE if we spent more time reading His word, He would have more opportunities to speak to us. Because when we open up His word, we open up our eyes and ears to hear at the same frequency in which He most frequently communicates.

As always, I'm preaching to myself...

## Tough Love

These last two days have been the hardest days our family has ever faced. We had to make a difficult decision that resulted in our two teenagers being removed from our home. If you don't know what that's like let me sum it up for you: Love. Hurts.

It's easy to second guess yourself. It's easy to give into those thoughts of doubt and allow the tension to form. Once the tension formed, the last thing on earth I wanted to do was put forth any effort at all to hear from God. I just wanted Him to fix it. What I love about our God the most is that His grace sees beyond our failures and He pursues us anyway. 

He placed the story of Abraham and Isaac on my heart. Now, I initially scoffed at the comparison if we're going to be honest But then I started thinking: There are stories about heros of the faith readily available for me to read, to be inspired by, and to learn from. It's less about the comparison of your life to their lives. These people modeled faith in action for us to learn from.

	Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!”

	And he said, “Here I am.”

	2 Then He said, “Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”

	3 So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. 4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. 5 And Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the lad[a] and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you.”

	6 So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together. 7 But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!”

	And he said, “Here I am, my son.”

	Then he said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”

	8 And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering.” So the two of them went together.

	9 Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. 10 And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.

	11 But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!”

	So he said, “Here I am.”

	12 And He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”

### 1. The calling doesn't always make sense

I've always avoided this story because it bothered me. How do you act on a word from God this crazy?  How do you have that kind of faith? The kind of faith that says: "God, it's not even worth me questioning this. You WILL provide."

We've found ourselves questioning His word for us over the last two days. "God, how is this better? How can you do something with this? How does this make sense?"

To be honest, this is where I've been stuck. I KNOW that He makes all things work together for the good of those who love Him. I KNOW that He has plans in store for my family. I've just been wanting to see them because none of this makes sense.

### 2. Faith doesn't require sight

Do you know what stuck out to me the most when I read this passage? Abraham looks up and sees the mountain where he most go and sacrifice his son. Listen to what he says:

> And Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you."

He doesn't say "and *I* will come back to you". He says "and *we* will come back to you." I LOVE that! Even if there is fear in his heart, he knows that there is power in the words that he speaks. He chooses to speak with confidence and authority that GOD WILL PROVIDE.

### 3. Bumps in the road are just potholes

Abraham speaks with confidence and by faith he marches up the mountain with Isaac. Have you wondered what it was like for him when he got there? I imagine Abraham expecting to see God himself waiting for him to tell him that he doesn't have to do this. If it were me, this would be the place that I lost it completely. I could no longer walk blindly. I would need to see something because nothing was making sense. But not Abraham. Abraham continues to act on faith up until the point where God DOES show up on the scene.

When I was really young, a friend of mine and I would ride our bikes everywhere. I remember a time when we were going down the street and had the bright idea of riding with our eyes closed. We timed each other to see how could go the longest. I honestly don't remember who "won", but I remember the first little bump that I hit. I was immediately convinced that I was about to die, my eyes flew open, and I screamed at the top of my lungs.

And I wonder how often we do this in our own lives. We're going down the road following God's plan for us blindly and BAM. We hit a bump in the road and then what do we do? We scream at the top our lungs. "This wasn't the deal, God! Where are you, God?? You're supposed to be here by now! I'm supposed to see you already!"

Abraham understood something. He understood that when God sets a plan in motion, He is willing and able to complete it. Abraham understood that when God calls you to walk in faith, that there are no bumps in the road big enough to take you down. Every bump is a tiny pothole and it's the enemy that's making you think that it's bigger than it really is but let me remind you of something: Our God is bigger, Our God is greater, and our God is stronger and He WILL complete the work that He has started in you!

So embrace the blindness. He will reveal himself when He chooses to. In the meantime, don't stress over the bumps. They're just potholes.
