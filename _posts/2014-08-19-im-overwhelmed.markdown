I was looking for distractions today so, naturally, I found myself on Facebook. A friend of mine posted a link to an article that caught my attention. I started to read the post but I got distracted by work (oh, the irony). All I remember is the scripture reference:
	
	When I am overwhelmed,
		you alone know the way I should turn
				- Psalms 142:3

I remember it because it struck a chord that resonated deep within me. "When I am overwhelmed". Yep, that's me! Can I just tell you something? When God captivates your attention, there's always more He's waiting to reveal to you. Dig deeper. And that's exactly what I did.

# I'm not overwhelmed, I'm just busy

Have you ever just been completely at the end of yourself? Where you don't even have the strength to THINK about taking the next step? Where you want to punch the next person that tries to comfort you or FIX your problem? Yeah, that's where we find David.

You know what I love about David? He was never afraid to just put it out there to God. "I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my trouble". What we need to take note of here is that how this whole thing starts. David says "I cry out to the Lord with my voice". This is as literal as it gets. He doesn't sit back and cry to himself. He voices his concerns to His father in Heaven.

I think too often we keep our problems to ourselves. We shove them into a dark place and pretend they don't exist. We push forward without giving any thought to the war that's raging inside of us because those issues that you think you have under control are working overtime to bring you down. Sooner or later, they're going to succeed. Your emotions are going to explode, your brain won't be able to comprehend anything but the intense urge to scream, and you're going to find yourself in a cave. 

It's time we take a few pointers from David.

### 1. Find a place to hide and cry out to God

For some of us, our instinct may be to run to the arms of a friend, spouse, or family when we reach the end of ourselves. I think that's healthy and I think there's a place for that but hear me out:

> When we're at the end of ourselves, we seek something that only God can provide.

That's not to say that God cannot speak through other people but what we need to be aware of is that we need to be seeking HIM. We have this habit of seeking validation and affirmation from everyone around us and forget that we have an audience of ONE. We set up those around of us for failure when we expect them to deliver what only God can give us. 

Surround yourself with people who will lift you up in prayer and encourage you to cry out to God. Maybe they'll even be willing to cry out with you!

### 2. Don't get comfortable where you are

David says "attend to my cry, for I am brought very low". It's interesting to me that he specifically said "I am brought very low". 

My son loves playing in the pool. One of my favorite memories with him is when we were playing with a ball in the water, trying to make it shoot up as high I could. I would shove it under the water, sit on top of it, and then slide off and away it would go. It's as if the ball couldn't wait another millisecond to escape the place that didn't belong.

David said "I am brought very low" not "I am very low". There's a difference. David understood that he didn't belong there, he was put there. He refused to become comfortable with his situation and instead pursued God and begged for deliverance.

### 3. You're about to change someone's life

When we're stuck in the darkness of a cave it's easy to make it all about us, isn't it? "God, why am I here?", "God, why is this happening to me?"

Listen to what David says at the end:
<br/>
<biblia:bibleverse theme="header" resource="nkjv" width="500" reference="Ps142.7"></biblia:bibleverse>

God, bring me out this prison. Get me out of this cave. Slide to the side and let me pop up out of this water. And when I do, I'm going to shoot up higher than you've ever seen because I understand that I don't belong. I understand that I have so much potential energy stored up and that when it's time, I'm going to explode with praise in a way that people can't help but notice!


You may be overwhelmed. You may be at the end of yourself. Just don't stop fighting. Don't get comfortable. It's time to pop up with praise because He's about to deliver you from whatever cave you've found yourself in.
