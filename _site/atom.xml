    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve been wanting to start this blog for quite some time now. It will be the home of my thoughts on leadership, ministry, and whatever else God is doing in our lives at the time. Some times its frustrations from parenting teenagers, practical jokes that I play on said teenagers, and other times I might get a little more serious.</p>

<h2>Follow our journey</h2>

<p>Olivia and I began a journey last year into a life of ministry. It was subtle at first but as time progressed, we began to realize the calling that God has placed on our lives...and we were terrified. The initial shock has worn off but we still don&#39;t really know what we&#39;re doing. All we know is that God is moving and I want to share what He&#39;s up to.</p>
