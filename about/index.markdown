## Who I am

![The family](https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t31.0-8/1410677_632043100171840_296133988_o.jpg)

I'm just a regular guy in Austin, TX (technically Manor but Austin sounds cooler). I'm a software leader and developer by trade (@jmarnold) that somehow found himself being called into ministry. This blog is where I write about the crazy things that God calls my wife and I to do. 

## What we do

I'm a passionate member of the worship team, we're leaders within Youth ministry, and we tend to do anything else that we're asked to do. My wife and I believe that God has called us to help build His church. We have no idea what that means in the long run. All we know is that we are called to serve under our amazing Pastors and their leadership team. Translation: we're "flexible" ;).

## Where to find us

My family and I are volunteers and members at The Exchange Church in Round Rock, TX.
